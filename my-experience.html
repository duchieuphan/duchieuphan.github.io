			<h1>My summer internship at GAPIT</h1>
		<div id="p1">
			<p>Summer 2017 had been meaningful for me. Decided to challenge myself applying for an intern position in such a professional and massive company - <b>GAPIT Communications JSC</b> has been my most proper decision ever since I was born. GAPIT did not only give me a precious chance to explore and develop myself, but also a wondeful environment to learn and work with full of seniors and co-workers, who are always willing to help the inexperienced one like me.</p>
			<p>23th June, 2017 marked the day I successfully became an intern at GAPIT as a specific role of<b> Digital Content Marketing Intern</b>. And it was quite interesting as well as nervous for me to found that I was the youngest worker of the company at that time. During my two-month internship period ( from 23th June, 2017 to 24th August, 2017) there, I participated in different projects to serve for different clients from different companies ( If you have not known yet, GAPIT is a well-known marketing agency in Hanoi).</p>
			<p>I am quite confident to say that a number of skills of mine have been highly-developed during the time being here. Initially, I have improved my writing skills as well as found out the key to customer insights throughout the campaign of writing Adtext with a view to promoting the Google Adwords campaigns for client companies. My professional skills such as applying Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator into works had also strongly been enhanced thanks to GAPIT projects.</p>
			<p>My network had also been expanded. Hading worked at GAPIT gave me an opportunity to work and get acquaintenced with experienced and warm-hearted seniors. I remebered that the company occasionally organized meetings and events for employees to gather and share their ideas about one another. Thanks to those, the relationships among employees became concreted, therefore, I am proudly to be a part of GAPIT, one big family.</p>
